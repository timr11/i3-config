These are my i3 window manager configuration files.\n
I set these up assuming Spotify is installed, changes include:\n
1. Font is now San Francisco size 13\n
2. Icons added to workspace tabs\n
3. Movement of focus from workspace to workspace is changed to keys: h,j,k,l, as opposed\n
   to the standard j,k,l,;, to replicate movement in Vim.\n
4. Vim settings are configured with Solarized colour scheme.
